This repository contains a Julia function that exhibits unexpected behavior when dealing with negative inputs. The issue stems from the order of operations within the function, which causes incorrect calculations.  The `bug.jl` file demonstrates the problem, while `bugSolution.jl` provides a corrected version of the function.
